# Stellar Evolution

## Leaving the main sequence

* Cannot observe a whole lifecycle
* Observe stars in star clusters to see all stages of evolution

* in main sequence, any fluctuations are quickly restored
    * must remain in hydrostatic equilibrium
    * if too hot, expands but has a gravitation increase inwards - decreases temperature
        * cools, and shrinks - repeats
    * happens with protostars before main sequence as well
    * as hydrogen leaves, the core is consumed and leaves main sequence

* what happens when a star leaves dependent on mass
    * low mass stars go quietly
    * high mass stars go out with a bang!
        * supernova

## Sun-like star

* main sequence
    * composition changes even when on main sequence
        * more helium replacing hydrogen from core outwards

* when no hydrogen in core
    * helium in core - core collapses
    * moves to subgiant branch

8. subgiant branch
    * core temperature goes up
9. helium flash
    * catastrophic onset of helium fusion 
    * cannot avoid collapse
    * helium turns into carbon
10. horizontal branch
    * turns helium into carbon until all is carbon
    * edge is helium, edgier edge is hydrogen
11. asymptotic-giant branch
    * helium -> carbon (more)
    * sun-sized star will die
12. Carbon core
    * collapses 
13. white dwarf
14. black dwarf

### Red-Giant branch

* (stage 9 for some stars)

* core shrinks, outer layers expand and cool
* now a red giant (L = R^2T^4)
* its luminosity increases due to size

### Helium flash

* pressure is totally due to electron degeneracy
* electron degeneracy - two electrons cannot be in same quantum state, so core cannot contract beyond certain point
    * fermions (matter particles - (electron, proton, neutron)) hate close quarters
    * radiation particles (photons) - love being in same quantum state
* pressure is independent of temperature - pressure cannot adjust when helium starts fusing
* once core has reached 100,000,000 K, helium fuses
* highly unstable and will decay in 10^(-12)s unless an alpha particle fuses with it
