# The obvious view

* the celestial sphere - stars seem to be on the inner surface of a sphere surrounding the earth
    * obviously this is bullshit

* declination - degrees north or south of celestial equator
* right ascension - measured in hours, minutes and seconds eastward from position of Sun at vernal equinox
* zenith - point on the celestial sphere directly above the observer
* nadir - diametric opposite of the zenith

## Angular Measurement

* Each circle contains 360 degrees
* Each degree contains 60' (arc-minutes)
* Each arc-minute contains 60" (arc-seconds)
* Angular size of an object depends on actual size and distance away

* Sun and moon have same arc sizes - total eclipse of sun
    * related to relative distances apart

* solar day - time from noon to noon (diurnal motion)
* noon - sun is highest overhead
* sidereal day - time in which fixed stars are in the same place

* sidereal year vs tropical year - I haven't been enough attention to really define this

## Earth's orbital motion

* seasonal changes to night sky are due to Earth's motion around the sun
* 12 constellations
* Sun moves through during the year are called the zodiac; path is elliptic

* Ecliptic - plane of the Earth's path; 23.5 degrees to celestial equator
* northnmost point is summer solstice
* sourthernmost point is winter solstice
* points where path cross celestial equator are vernal and autumnal equinoxes

* Combination of day length and sunlight angle gives seasons
* tropical year - time from one vernal equinox to next

* Precession - rotation of Earth's axis itself; makes one complete circle in about 26,000 years
