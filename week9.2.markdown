# Evolution of a Sun-like star

* Helium begins to fuse extremely rapidly
    * brightest luminosity, also giant
* star reaches equilibrium
    * converting helium into carbon at core
    * converting hydrogen into helium at core

## Stage 10 Helium Fusion

Once temperature has reach 100,000,000K, helium fuses through three-alpha process

* He + He -> Be + energy
* Be + He -> C + energy

## Stage 11 giant branch

* The core becomes hotter and hotter and the helium burns faster and faster
* The star is now similar to its situation just after it left the main sequence - but with two shells
* Core only produces heat from collapse
* Core contracts even more
* Becomes red giant a second time

## Death of a low mass stars (sun is highest mass low mass star)

* Such stars never become hot enough for fusion passed carbon to take place
* There is no more outward fusion (only carbon ash) fusion pressure which continues to contract
* The outer layers become unstable and are eventually ejected
* Ejected bits turn into a planetary nebula

## Stage 13 and 14 White and Black Dwarves

* core is very hot and very small - white dwarf
* as it cools, it gets dimmer and dimmer and turns into a black dwarf

## Blue stragglers

* recent stars, formed probably from smaller stars

# Evolution of stars more massive than the sun

* leave main sequence when no more hydrogen in core
* similar to low-mass: hydrogen shell, helium -> carbon

* smooth transitions - no sharp transitions

* star of 8 solar masses will fuse far beyond carbon
    * stays about in the same place on the H-R diagram
