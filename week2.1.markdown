# Motion of the moon

Eclipses don't occur every month because Earth's and Moon's orbits are not in the same plane.

# Triangulation

* Measurement baseline and angles, can calculate distance.
* Parallax - similar to triangulation, but look at apparent motion of object against distance from two vantage point
    * amount of parallax is inversely proportional to the amount of distance

## converting baselines and parallaxes to distances

* baseline is how much it moved during parallax

distance * (parallax / 360) = (Baseline / 2Ï€)
distance = (57.3 / parallex) * baseline

# measuring distances with geometry

* find angular size of object
